# Project 2  
## First Part  
### Challenge  
  
The customer needs update the storage clothing in each store for October of 2019.  

### Objective  
  
Precisely predict the weekly sales considering seasonality, trend and explanatory variables. For additional, should be done an analysis of the data that will be used in the model.  
  
## Second Part  
  
The customer does not know the data that are in the bases of data and its potential.  

### Objective  
  
Must create an idea unique and creative that takes advantage of available data. This can involve the development of new features, identification trends or proposed data-driven solutions for address challenges or take advantage specific opportunities.  
  
## Data
  
- cities.csv (2 KB)
- product.csv (47 KB)
- sales.csv (648.3 MB)

These files were added to the repository via [git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).  

## Notebook
  
All the steps done for this project are done in the [notebook](https://github.com/vhpei/Projeto_2/blob/main/Projeto_2.ipynb) within this repository, the notebook repository is presented as follows.  
Along the notebook it contains comments throughout the code and conclusions for the data analysis for example.
