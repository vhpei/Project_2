# Projeto_2
Project for a Post Graduation in Data

For this projetct we were placed with two challenges one of them is the prediction of revenue for the weeks of October 2019.
For this we thought to use methods like Arima, Sarima and Sarimax, and other simpler methods.

As this is our learning journey we have tried in some of the commits to use some Deep Learning algorithms such as LSTM, However the results weren't so good so we decided to not go through with it.

The second challenge is to retrieve insights from the data.
For this purpose, we will use PowerBI.

In this repository, in addition to this readme file, you can find.
