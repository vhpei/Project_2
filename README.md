# Projeto_2
Project for a Post Graduation in Data

For this projetct we were placed with two challenges one of them is the prediction of revenue for the weeks of October 2019.
For this we thought to use methods like Arima, Sarima and Sarimax.
For specific stores this methods aren't possible therefore in those stores we will try to use other methods.
Ss this is our leraning journey we will also try to use some Deep Learning algorithms such as LSTM, eventhough we believe that it won't provide us with better results then the other Machine Learning Algorithms.

The second challenge is to retrieve insights from the data.
For this purpose, we will first use PowerBI.
